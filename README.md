# Source files for the datapoints.studio website

This is a repository for a Jekyll website, with a Tufte theme (https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll).

The code may be used by potential contributors to recreate the site locally for testing before publication (through a Pull request). The code is publicly available, solely for the purpose of facilitating the work with contributors, the ones who want to add their analysis and data visualizations to the website.

Main steps to contribute:
- Fork the repo, clone and serve/build locally with Jekyll;
- Add your analysis: create a file in the `_posts` directory using an example file already there and add any assets (images, notebooks, etc.) in the `assets` directory. See the file `README-jekyll.md` for specific formatting instructions;
- Build locally to see how it looks;
- Commit to your fork, then send a Pull Request;
- Once merged, the website at datapoints.studio gets built automatically.

We are excited to learn what you wish to add to Data Points Studio!
